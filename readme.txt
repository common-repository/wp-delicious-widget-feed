1. screenshot-1.png This is how the widget/plug-in looks from the administration sections, of course actual appearance will depend on the browser you are using at the time you are viewing. This screen-shot was taken using Firefox. So looks may vary.

2. screenshot-2.png Delicious Feed as it looks for the front-end to your users, This is using the current themes css file for styling so the actual look will vary depending on your themes style. Your plugin will be styled like the rest of your sidebar widgets as this plugin uses your themes css file for styling and does not have its own built it styles.
